> Can you pull into my feature branch and review the changes locally?

I saw this phrase appear again and again while contributing to Open Source. Before I knew the `git` commands to accomplish pulling into a feature branch, I tried thinking about how I would actually get the changes from a remote branch. It seemed straightforward, fetch changes from an upstream branch and checkout your own local branch with those fetched changes. Turns out it was really quite simple, but we need to specify an associated pull request ID when fetching the remote branch.

```git
git fetch origin pull/id/head:$BRANCHNAME
```

We fetch the changes from a specific feature branch and then can use `git checkout` to switch branches into the feature branch.

```git
git fetch origin pull/2/head:563-some-bug-fix

git checkout 563-some-bug-fix
```

That's it. Fetch changes from a local or remote feature branch and switch branches to the newly created branch from the fetch. If your pulling into a feature branch from a remote repository, use `upstream` instead of `origin`.

```git
git fetch upstream pull/id/head:$BRANCHNAME
```

Lets say there was a pull request with `id` equaling 25 and the branch this PR was submitted from is `323-fix-async`. The following usage would be:

```git
git fetch upstream pull/25/head:323-fix-async

```

Then switch branches into the feature branch with `git checkout`.

```git
git checkout 323-fix-async

Switched to branch '323-fix-async'
```

Now you have a local copy of the changes in a upstream feature branch, its time to start revewing and approve or reject those changes! If you want to see what branch your currently on, use `git branch`.

<h2 class="post-heading">Pulling on a branch</h2>

Let's say we had a feature branch named `112-fix-buffer` that we submitted some changes on in a public repository called `the-buffer-proj`. When someone else pulls into your feature branch 112-fix-buffer and makes changes then pushes those changes. Your branch locally will be "behind" as there are changes proposed by others that you haven't synced with yet. To get up-to-date (merge) with your own branch just pull on it to get the latest changes.

```cpp
git pull origin 112-fix-buffer
```

This will perform a fetch and merge of remote commits.
