I enjoy creating illustrations with [Vectornator](https://www.vectornator.io/) and making other neat things with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I've always been interested in illustration and design but my CSS art journey began when I read [this article](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2014/09/single-div-drawings-with-css/) on Mozilla Hacks about single div drawings. I was instantly hooked on making illustrations with CSS and that has led me to pursue other avenues for drawing like Vectornator.

My more recent works are either drawn on iPad using Vectornator or created with HTML/CSS and can be found on CodePen. I have strayed away from single div drawings and now tend to use a few more HTML elements for CSS art, sort of like "layers" where each layer is a component of the larger illustration. As opposed to using a single {% raw %}`<div>`{% endraw %} with many box-shadows, which can become difficult to keep track of in more complex drawings. Now that I've started making illustrations with Vectornator, you can find my illustration work over on [dribbble](https://dribbble.com/tannerdolby) and CSS art on [CodePen](https://codepen.io/tannerdolby).
