I enjoy creating illustrations with [Vectornator](https://www.vectornator.io/) and making other neat things with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I've always been interested in art and design but my journey as a CSS artist and illustrator when I read [this article](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2014/09/single-div-drawings-with-css/) on Mozilla Hacks about single div drawings. I was instantly hooked on making illustrations with CSS and that has led me to pursue other software for drawing like vectornator. One of the reasons I love drawing and illustrating is because I can use basic shapes and geometry to create the foundation for complex illustrations.

My more recent drawings are either drawn on iPad using Vectornator or created with HTML and CSS. I have strayed away from single div drawings and now tend to use a few more HTML elements for CSS art, sort of like "layers" where each layer is a component of the larger illustration. I enjoy using many elements for certain drawings because it helps me to stay organized larger drawings. As opposed to using a single {% raw %}`<div>`{% endraw %} with many box-shadows, which can become difficult to keep track of in more complex drawings. Now that I've started making illustrations with Vectornator, you can find my illustration work over on [dribbble](https://dribbble.com/tannerdolby) and CSS art on [CodePen](https://codepen.io/tannerdolby).
