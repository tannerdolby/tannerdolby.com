Hi there! My name is Tanner Dolby. I'm a software engineer and mathematician based out of California. I enjoy working with JavaScript, C++, HTML, CSS, Node.js, TypeScript, and Python. I'm interested in applying my skills to build performant software. My academic background is in mathematics, that is I'm a self taught programmer.

I like contributing to open source projects on GitHub and learning new things along the way. I also enjoy reading books and technical documentation then building things. This has proved to be a really surefire way to better understand a topic or concept. Throughout my life I've always been a problem solver, which I think is the part of the reason why I enjoy playing Sudoku and Chess. I tend to think of programming as a lifelong journey where there is always something to learn or become better at.

I spend most of my free time contributing to open source projects on [GitHub][github], learning new things, creating illustrations, building side projects, running, and making front-end demos on [CodePen][codepen]. With the JAMstack movement on the rise, I've taken an interest in Static Site Generators (SSG). In particular [Eleventy][eleventy], which this website is built with.

## Interests

I like to write about programming and technology. I'm currently fixated on learning more about C++, game dev with Phaser, Chrome extensions, and Web Performance. If you would like to see me write about a specific topic or concept, feel free to message me on Twitter about it. 

I enjoy writing documentation (and referencing it) so when I'm learning new content, I tend to take notes and write a blog post or something to document and reinforce what I learned. When I'm not on the computer, you can find me creating illustrations on my iPad, reading a good book, running, skateboarding, and trying to become a better photographer.

### Photography

I'm using a Sony DSLR camera. This is my first real deal camera with all the bells and whistles so I'm still trying to figure out how exactly to use it. Once I do, the photos taken will be added to a gallery here on my website to document my journey as a photographer.

## Education

I received my Bachelor of Science in Applied Mathematics from Arizona State University on May 11, 2020. Due to a [global pandemic][pandemic], the university didn't conduct an in-person commencement ceremenony. Feel free to take a look at the [virtual ceremonies][grad ceremony]. 

During my time at ASU, I worked as an Undergraduate Researcher and Supplemental Instruction leader for Differential Equations. My passion for mathematics and computing became most apparent to me after completing discrete math and linear algebra. At the moment, I don't have plans for attending grad school but I'm interested in pursuing a graduate degree in Computer Science at some point.
