Hi there! My name is Tanner Dolby. I'm a Software Engineer and Mathematician based in California. I enjoy working with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node, React, Python, Java, and C++. I started programming in 2018 with Swift and began learning web development using [freeCodeCamp.org](https://freecodecamp.org) in 2019. Ever since then, I've been hooked on writing code and building things for the web.

I spend most of my free time contributing to open source projects on GitHub, learning new things, creating illustrations, building side projects, running, and making front-end demos on [CodePen](https://codepen.io/tannerdolby). With the JAMstack movement on the rise, I've taken an interest in Static Site Generators (SSG). In particular [Eleventy](https://11ty.dev), which this website is built with.

## Interests

I like to write about programming and technology. I'm currently fixated on learning more about Chrome extensions, Compilers, C++, and Web performance. If you would like to see me write about a specific topic or concept, feel free to message me on Twitter about it. Lately, I've been interested in developing Chrome Extensions and spending time creating illustrations using [Vectornator](https://www.vectornator.io/). I enjoy writing documentation (and referencing it) so when I'm learning new content, I tend to take notes and write a blog post or something to document and reinforce what I learned. 

When I'm not on the computer, you can find me creating illustrations on my iPad, reading a good book, running, skateboarding, finding the best slice of pizza, and trying to become a better photographer.

### Photography

I'm currently using a Sony A7s II camera with a Sony FE 50mm lens. This is my first real deal camera with all the bells and whistles so I'm still trying to figure out how exactly to use it. Once I do, the photos taken will be added to a gallery here on my website to document my journey as a photographer.

## Education

I received my Bachelor of Science in Applied Mathematics from Arizona State University on May 11, 2020. Due to a [global pandemic](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html), the university didn't conduct an in-person commencement ceremenony. Feel free to take a look at the [virtual ceremonies](https://vgradasu.z4.web.core.windows.net/asu/III/#811351). 

During my time at ASU, I worked as an Undergraduate Researcher and Supplemental Instruction leader for Differential Equations. My passion for mathematics and computing became most apparent to me after completing discrete math and linear algebra. At the moment, I don't have plans for attending grad school but I'm interested in pursuing a graduate degree in Computer Science at some point.
